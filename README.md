# Empty

## What can I see here?

This repository features a/n (nearly) empty HTML file (actually it is just the Emmet HTML Boilerplate because idk if GitHub pages posts totally empty files).

## What is this for?

I mostly want to get into drawing flipbook animations, so I run this page on my Kindle, to have a white background. You can also use this to Zen or whatever, or just as a white canvas to imagine stuff on, feel free to use this as a think tank...if whiteboard apps are too fancy for you.

## What will I see here in the future?

Short answer: Nothing<br>
Long answer: Maybe I get around to do a screen color accuracy test in some time but I doubt that I will maintain this a lot. Maybe this will one day be a project we look down to and be like: Remember back then, when we used HTML?
