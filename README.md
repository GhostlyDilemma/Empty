# Empty
## What?
This repository features a (nearly) empty HTML file.

## Why?
I mostly want to get into drawing flipbook animations, so I run this page on my Kindle, to have a white background. You can also use this to Zen or whatever, or just as a white canvas to imagine stuff on, feel free to use this as a think tank... if whiteboard apps are too fancy for you.

## When will I get more of this?
Short answer: Never.

Long answer: Maybe I get around to do a screen color accuracy test in some time, but I doubt that I will maintain this a lot. Maybe this will one day be a project we look down upon and reminisce.

## Contributing
If you can add even more nothingness to Empty, feel free to submit something, I hope I don't forget to check.
